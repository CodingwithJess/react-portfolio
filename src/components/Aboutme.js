      I remember the first time I built a good looking and responsive website from scratch.
      *BOOM*
      Magic. Right before my eyes.
      
      Every time I sit down to code I am in awe of the endless possibilities, limited only by the speed at which I'm able to learn and apply a new language or framework.
      
      I am an aspiring full-stack web developer who has a deep passion for brewing up web designs, conquering bugs, integrating fully responsive mobile friendly sites, building servers, incorporating API's, mastering git collaboration, and continuing to learn in a fast changing industry.
      
      Full-stack web development also calls to many of my best qualities. The artistic and endlessly creative side of Front End, and the analytical and robust side of Back End.
      
      Coding has me spellbound and I cannot wait to see where the journey takes me.</p></div>
